06/17/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

	* sources.c: Make sure orig_buf is valid.

06/17/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

	* Makefile.am: Added tokenizer directory to compile script
	* highlight.c: removed highligh_c and highlight_ada
	removed c_types, c_keywords, ada_types, ada_keywords
	Added new function highlight_node which interfaces with the new
	tokenizer library.
	* sources.c: Changed load_file, it calls the new highlight function.

06/14/2003 Mike Mueller <mmueller@cs.uri.edu>
    * highlight.c: Fixed bug in left/right scrolling when tab characters present

06/14/2003 Peter Kovacs <peter@kovax.org>

    * commands.c: Added support for parsing set foo=bar type variables.  Added
    support for parsing configuration files (somewhat incomplete at this
    point).
    * cgdb.c: Added support for parsing ~/.cgdb/cgdbrc configuration file.

06/14/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

	* commands.c: Implemented tab_stop feature. Changed tabspace to tabstop.
				  Changed parse error call from printf to if_print_message.
 	* highlight.c: changed to use tabstop variable.
	* interface.c: Added if_print_message.
	* interface.h: Added if_print_message.

06/12/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

	* commands.c: sorted VARIABLES structure

06/11/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

	* sources.h,added field covered_lines to list_node: This field is used
	to record all the line numbers ( per file ) that gdb has directed the 
	user to go to. This was inteded to work with actuall lines the user has
	covered. However, if the user does up/down, then those lines get added
	also.
	* sources.c: Changed some calls from malloc to xmalloc. 
	Added new option called line_coverage_option.
	* interface.c: added call to redisplay the screen when a command is
	recieved via the status bar.
	* commands.c: Added new command line_coverage_option.

06/04/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * cgdb.c: process_commands, changed interface between cgdb/tgdb.
    tgdb now sends atomic commands. self contained.

06/01/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>
    
    * cgdb.c: init_home_dir now uses fs_util interface instead of
    trying to figure out paths itself.
    * cgdb.c: create_help_file now also uses fs_util interface.

06/01/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * cgdb.c: tgdb interface changed. Removing old call to tgdb_init and 
    tgdb_start and calling only tgdb_init with the correct parameters.

version 0.3.1 (04/28/2003):

04/27/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Reorganized the cvs tree

version 0.3.0 (04/11/2003):

04/11/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Focus initially set to GDB window

04/09/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * If start_gdb fails, then cgdb exits cleanly.

04/05/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed CGDB_ESC_KEY to 27 for the several spots still calling wgetch
    * Fixed bug where if you enter a regex and then hit ESC to cancel, the
    line would never go away.

04/03/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * interface.c ( if_draw ): Removed a function that called refresh
    on the status bar. Also, Added a check to refresh the cgdb window
    if focus == cgdb.
    * cgdb.c ( remove realpath ): There is no more call to realpath to 
    determine the breakpoint.
    * Add another hack to keep relative file from file dialog: This way
    when the user sets a breakpoint on a file opened from the file 
    dialog, the relative file is known.

04/02/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Removed filedlg's main loop: filedlg's main loop is gone. It is now
    driven from cgdb's main loop. It recieve's a char at a time.
    * Removed call to wgetch in the process of removing filedlg's main loop
    * Removed optimizations from sources.c and scroller.c: I added a variable
    to determine if these objects needed to be displayed again. They are not
    worth the effort to maintain, since sometimes the screen NEEDS to be
    drawn again.

04/01/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * cgdb now works on windows XP in cygwin: Fixed creation of home directory.
    * Try to make configure fail if readline is not installed on system.

03/29/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Fixed all of cgdb's to work with autoconf: All of the files that make up
    cgdb now test to see if a header is available before it is included.

03/27/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed cgdb to version 0.3.0 in cvs.

03/26/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Fixed resizing with new input library: cgdb now writes to a pipe in the
    signal handler that gets triggered in the select loop which does the
    resize. It used to do ungetch.
    * Fixed return values of _input functions in cgdb.c: These functions would
    quit on there own. They have no right to do so, they should report an
    error and have cgdb quit in some common location
    * Changed configure from --with-driver to --with-drivers: The reason for
    this is because now there are several driver programs that can be used to
    test cgdb.
    * Removed cgdb's handling of esc code sequences: cgdb was looking for esc
    sequences. It was looking for Shift-Arrow keys and Home and End. This has
    been replaced with new input library.

03/25/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Integrated new input unit into cgdb: cgdb no longer uses getch to get
    input from the terminal. This is useful because now cgdb can know the high
    level characters ( CGDB_KEY_UP ) and it can also know the esc seq
    associated with them. So it can send them to readline.

03/23/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Fixed interface to tgdb to allow the new readline support: This fixes
    the bug where alt-D did not work, and the ^r ( reverse search ) bug would
    cause cgdb to block. It also fixes the existing bug in cgdb, it did not
    print the output of tgdb_send.

03/06/2003 Mike Mueller <mmueller@cs.uri.edu>

    * White terminal fix: Fixed cgdb to automatically paint the entire
    window black when opened, so the screen isn't messy on white backgrounds.
    * Fixed search repeats: Modified 'n' key behavior so that it does nothing
    when pressed if no search was previously specified.

03/06/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Updated cgdb to work with the new Command interface. tgdb now returns a
    nice queue instead of a triple pointer 'struct Command *'

03/02/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Readline has been cleanly added with a pty: Now, cgdb opens a pty,
    tells readline that that is its stdin, it also creates an ordinary pipe to
    read from readline's ouput.
    * Made readline not install any signal handler's

02/26/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Implemented new changes to the libtgdb interface to support readline:
    cgdb should now be able to send all the data the user typed to tgdb, 
    and tgdb figures out what data to send back and in what order.
    * Fixed crash in cgdb: If user hit ' ' into the cgdb window when there
    was no file selected, cgdb would crash.

02/24/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Fixed interface between cgdb and tgdb: cgdb gets the prompt from 
    tgdb now instead of guessing its '(gdb) '
    * Fixed readline include problem. stdio.h must be included first

02/23/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Major re-write, adding readline support: cgdb now uses the readline
    library directly for getting input from the user.


02/16/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed configure file src/Makefile.am: libtgdb is now a single library.

02/12/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>
   
   * Fixed cgdb to interface with new tgdb
   * Removed macro support from cgdb: It was using tgdb's macro
   support which has been removed. The macro support should be done
   from the application level.

02/11/2003 Bob Rossi <bob_rossi@cox.net>
   
   * Added the command to goto a line in the source window: This options was
   present before but it was not picked up by the new command parser.
   * Changed searching keys: the 'n' key to mean 'next forward search' 
   and the 'N' key to mean 'next reverse search'.
   * Changed file buffer key commands: 'b' goes back a file. 'f' goes
   forward a file.
   * Removed the '.' command: It is useless :)

02/05/2003 Peter Kovacs <peter@kovax.org>

    * Integrated new command parser: commands.c now takes care of processing
    all :commands and all :set commands.  Added new commands :insert :next
    :run :continue :macro_run :macro_save :macro_start.  Added verbose set
    commands :set ignorecase and :set shortcut.

version 0.2.3 (01/30/2003):

01/29/2003  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Fixed the resize problem on solaris by not calling signal:
    cgdb no longer calls the signal function to say that it wants to
    catch a signal. It now uses the POSIX signal handler functions instead.
    This fixed the resizing issue on solaris.

01/25/2003  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * removed h key, it is depricated: :help should be used instead.
    * removed ^k, it is depricated: :q and :q! should be used instead.

01/24/2003  Mike Mueller  <mmueller@cs.uri.edu>

    * Added quit command: Added :q and :q! commands.
    * Fixed 'current line' discrepancy: Using the :123 line format, the
    'G', and the 'gg' commands, actually altered the current executing line
    pointer in the interface.  Fixed this so that the user-selected line is
    changed, but the current executing line remains unchanged.
    * Changed arrow in source window: Changed the - (dash) to an ACS_LTEE
    character.  If this causes problems on some systems, I'll remove it.
    * Changed GDB window tabs: Modified the GDB output window's tab 
    behavior to resemble a standard terminal.  This means tab stops every 
    8 characters, instead of just translating tabs to a fixed amount of spaces.
    * Added logo: Added a few ASCII art logos to cgdb.  

version 0.2.2 (01/23/2003):

01/23/2003  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed file dialog: cgdb's file dialog now does not display all
    the files in strcmp order. It puts regular files first, then relative
    files ( files that start with '.' ) and then absolute files.

01/22/2003  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed current line color: cgdb now displays the current line
    as bright white, not red ( that's already ment a breakpoint )

version 0.2.1 (01/19/2003):

01/18/2003  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed the configure scripts for select.h: Changed the configure
    script to not fail if select.h isn't on the host.
    * Changed the configure scripts: Changed configure to only build
    cgdb with ncurses unless the user types --with-curses. And then
    it will try to build with curses. The reason is that cgdb does
    not work that well with curses on all systems.

version 0.2 (01/13/2003):

01/08/2003  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed cgdb to traverse previously viewed source files: The user
    can traverse through the source files that have been viewed.

01/05/2003  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed cgdb to have some command line support: cgdb now has 
    command line support to print help, version and allow the user 
    to pick which debugger cgdb should use.

01/04/2003  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed cgdb to support colon commands: When the user types
    a colon (:) from the source window they can enter a command. If the 
    command is garbage, then No such command: ... is displayed. Otherwise,
    the command is processed. Currently the only two commands are
    ':set ic' and ':set noic'.

12/28/2002  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed cgdb, added file helptext.h which contains the help file:
    The file helptext.h now contains an array which is the help file that
    gets displayed when the user hits the 'h' key in the source window.
    This will eventually be the manual.
    * Changed cgdb, can print long messages to status bar now: added 
    if_display_message to interface. This allows printing of lines that are 
    longer than the terminal is wide.
    * Changed tgdb and cgdb to have support for one macro: To test out
    the macro support I have added the ability to run one macro.

12/27/2002  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed cgdb to have a help dialog: When the user hits 'h' a help 
    dialog appears. cgdb looks in $HOME/.cgdb/help.txt for the file. 
    However, as of know the file is not being created. Copying a file
    there manually does the trick. This will be changed when I can 
    determine what the correct method of copying the file should be.
    ( make install, creating the file in the c code, ... )

12/22/2002  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed cgdb to handle input to the debugged program via a pty:
    This is a major change. It allows the debugged program to recieve input
    through gdb's tty command. This seperates gdb's input and the debugged
    program's input. It is the initial "tty-window" release.

12/21/2002  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>

    * Changed status bar info: Either shows the current file name, or it shows
    the search, reverse search or line search. Full line.

version 0.1.1 (12/19/2002):

12/19/2002  Bob Rossi  <bob_rossi@cox.net>
    * Fixed Resize window event: The resizing of the cgdb application was not
    occuring when the focus was on the gdb window.
    * Fixed regex color highlighting bug in the source window: When searching
    with the regex in the source window, the color that was matched was 
    incorrect. Fixed the algorithm and made it more efficient.
    * Fixed sources so they compile on AIX 4.3: Got cgdb to compile and run
    on AIX 4.3. It doesn't run perfect yet ( the curses is out of wack,
    displaying order , color ... ) but it compiles and runs.
    * Fixed bug in processing ada breakpoint exception output from gdb: If the
    user set a breakpoint on an exception in ada, the tgdb library would not
    be able to parse the output from gdb's command 'info breakpoints'.

version 0.1 (12/09/2002)  <mmueller@cs.uri.edu>

    * Wrote Initial version of cgdb: Basically designed and wrote cgdb. All
    the initial thought ( algorithms, structures ) was done previous to this
    date.
