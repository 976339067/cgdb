   * clexer.l: Fixed a bug with string literals. A rule to match
   '\"' has been added.
   * clexer.l: Fixed rule '\\\"' to generalize to all sequences of '\\.'
   This now seems to make all character literals that begin with a \
   work properly.

	* clexer.l: Fixed the IDENTIFIER rule. Now Identifiers like
	BASE64 match, instead of BASE and then 64.
