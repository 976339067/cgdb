Steps for releasing a new CGDB version, follow these in order.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All of the steps below are automated by autorelease.sh, just check to make
sure that it worked properly.

- Run autorelease.sh version, where version could be '0.6.2'

- This check for
  * aclocal (GNU automake) 1.9.5
  * autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.59
  * m4      ( GNU m4 )     1.4.3

- This updates configure.in to have new version number in the
  AC_INIT macro.

- This step runs autoregen.sh

-  This section generates all the applicable documentation. Make sure the file
   doc/version.texi has the new version numbers. The date in this file is the 
   date corresponding to the last time the file was modified.

   Make sure that doc/cgdb.1, doc/cgdb.info and doc/cgdb.txt are all updated.
   Also, version.texi.builddir/doc/cgdb.pdf, 
   version.texi.builddir/doc/cgdb-no-split.html

-  Run version.texi.builddir/tmp/target/bin/cgdb --version to check 
   version number.

-  Ensure tag is written. If the version is cgdb-0.3.3, name the tag
   cgdb-0_3_3 .
