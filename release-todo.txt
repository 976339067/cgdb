Steps for releasing a new CGDB version, follow these in order.

-  Change configure.in file to reflect new version number.
      * Run autoregen.sh
    Make sure you have the appropriate versions of these installed:
      * aclocal (GNU automake) 1.9.5
      * autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.59
      * libtool ( GNU libtool ) 1.5.6
      * m4      ( GNU m4 )     1.4.3

-  This section generates all the applicable documentation. Make sure the file
   doc/version.texi has the new version numbers. You will probably have to 
   configure CGDB with --enable-maintainer-mode for this to happen. I have yet
   to determine a better way.

   It's important to store the text and info version of the 
   documentation in the doc directory, for releases. The info version is
   always available in cgdb/doc/cgdb.infl. However, the text version must
   be generated. Run 'make html', and then copy the command and replace 
   '--html' with '--plaintext', and output the file to cgdb/doc/cgdb.txt. 
   Then run 'perl ht.pl'. CGDB's source has now been modified. Check in the 
   new files.

   Now is also the time to create the pdf file 'make pdf' and the single file
   html file. Check in any new generated documentation at this point.

-  Make sure the man page is updated. Run help2man like this,
   'help2man ./cgdb' > cgdb.1. This only need to be done if the
   usage is modified.

-  Update all ChangeLogs to have the new release date and version.
    The ChangeLogs live in many places currently.
    find . -name ChangeLog

-  Update the NEWS file to have the new release date and version.
    
-  Test doing 'make dist' then untar, ./configure && make
    and run ./cgdb --version to check version number.

-  Commit all currently modified files (should only be ChangeLogs).

-  Create a cvs tag for the tree to be able to get back to the 
    version number. If the version is cgdb-0.3.3, name the tag
	cgdb-0_3_3 .

-  Put a release on sourceforge.net/projects/cgdb
    * ftp upload.sourceforge.net
      * user=anonymous, passwd=email
      * type bin
      * cd incoming
      * put the file up
    * go to sourceforge.net/projects/cgdb
    * go to admin, then "file releases"
    * Click "Add release"
    * New release name (ie. cgdb-0.5.1)
	* you should be able to put whats new in the NEWS file into the
	  release notes.

-  Download and test the new version from sourceforge.

-  Update website cgdb.sourceforge.net:
    * change webpage in cgdb/doc/htdocs
    * Modify download page -> download.shtml
      * Download link
      * Optionally, put a note in the index.shtml file (News section)
    * ssh cgdb.sourceforge.net
    * cd /home/groups/c/cg/cgdb/htdocs
	* run 'cvs update'

- Update documentation on website. You will need to scp from your computer
  to cgdb.sf.net to get files uploaded. Then you will need to copy over
  cgdb.pdf, cgdb.html, cgdb.text, cgdb-split.html and cgdb.info.

-  Test website by looking at it and attempting to download file.
    
-  Announce the release on freshmeat

-  Announce the release on cgdb-announce@lists.sourceforge.net
