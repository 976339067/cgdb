A lot of work to do for cgdb-0.4.0

1. Rename driver to annotate_driver
2. Get configure to only build cgdb and rlctx_prog and build the driver
   programs on request.
3. Integrate gdbmi into libtgdb and make gdbmi_driver
4. Add a dejagnu testsuite to the annotate_driver and gdbmi_driver
5. Create a better interface to the front ends
6. Rework tgdb to be able to support multiple types of debugging (annotate,mi)
   This involves making a better interface to running commands through the
   debbuger and through readline.
7. Reorganize tgdb to have a separate low level lib for ADT's and for
   util calls like xmalloc. This is so all programs can use it without
   linking to libtgdb.
8. Move rlctx_prog to another directory
