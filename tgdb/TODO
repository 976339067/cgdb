A lot of work to do for cgdb-0.4.0

1. Add a dejagnu testsuite to the annotate_driver and gdbmi_driver

2. Get configure to only build cgdb, and build the driver programs on request.

3. Create a better interface to the front ends

4. Integrate gdbmi into libtgdb

5. Make driver use both annotate and gdbmi

6. Rework tgdb to be able to support multiple types of debugging (annotate,mi)
   This involves making a better interface to running commands through the
   debbuger and through readline.

Finished:

7. Reorganize tgdb to have a separate low level lib for ADT's and for
   util calls like xmalloc. This is so all programs can use it without
   linking to libtgdb.

8. Move rlctx_prog to another directory

9. Figure out how to make rlctx not require another program to use.
