A lot of work to do for cgdb-0.4.0

1. Add a dejagnu testsuite to the annotate_driver and gdbmi_driver

2. Create a better interface to the front ends

3. Rework tgdb to be able to support multiple types of debugging (annotate,mi)
   This involves making a better interface to running commands through the
   debbuger and through readline.

    4. Integrate gdbmi into libtgdb

    5. Make driver use both annotate and gdbmi

Finished:

Get configure to only build cgdb, and build the driver programs on request.

Reorganize tgdb to have a separate low level lib for ADT's and for
util calls like xmalloc. This is so all programs can use it without
linking to libtgdb.

Move rlctx_prog to another directory

Figure out how to make rlctx not require another program to use.
