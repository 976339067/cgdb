Pushed off for gdb 0.5.0

1. Integrate gdbmi stubs into libtgdb and get gdbmi integrated into tgdb

2. Get assembly language working.

3. Get tab completion to work through readline ?
   This is *very* difficult to do. I don't know if it is possible.

4. Modify the readline library to be context driven.
	
Work to do for cgdb-0.4.0

1. Fix interface to not return strings to the gui, but return structures.
   like breakpoints, source files, ...
2. Fix tgdb to call the lower level subsystems in an independent way.
3. standardize the way TGDB returns paths to the front end.
   As of know, it returns the full path with the relative path. Then
   it returns a relative path for breakpoints and source files. The front end 
   then needs to look up the full path from the relative path.

Finished:

Fix interface to have all functions return an 'int'

Rework tgdb to be able to support multiple types of debugging (annotate,mi)
This involves making a better interface to running commands through the
debbuger and through readline.

Make annotate-two use the new architecture. This way, gdbmi will integrate 
easier. This is done, however, there is still no clear interface between
annotate and tgdb-base. This needs to be clearly defined before going 
trying to add gdbmi.

Get configure to only build cgdb, and build the driver programs on request.

Reorganize tgdb to have a separate low level lib for ADT's and for
util calls like xmalloc. This is so all programs can use it without
linking to libtgdb.

Move rlctx_prog to another directory

Figure out how to make rlctx not require another program to use.

Add a dejagnu testsuite to the annotate_driver and gdbmi_driver
	This needs to include many more tests.
