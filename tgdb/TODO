A lot of work to do for cgdb-0.4.0

1. Add a dejagnu testsuite to the annotate_driver and gdbmi_driver

2. Create a better interface to the front ends

3. Integrate gdbmi stubs into libtgdb
    The actual integration of gdbmi will be done by 0.5.0

4. Get tab completion to work through readline ?

Finished:

Rework tgdb to be able to support multiple types of debugging (annotate,mi)
This involves making a better interface to running commands through the
debbuger and through readline.

Make annotate-two use the new architecture. This way, gdbmi will integrate 
easier. This is done, however, there is still no clear interface between
annotate and tgdb-base. This needs to be clearly defined before going 
trying to add gdbmi.

Get configure to only build cgdb, and build the driver programs on request.

Reorganize tgdb to have a separate low level lib for ADT's and for
util calls like xmalloc. This is so all programs can use it without
linking to libtgdb.

Move rlctx_prog to another directory

Figure out how to make rlctx not require another program to use.
