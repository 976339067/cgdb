cgdb-0.3.3b

	* Fixed string literal bug where files don't highlight properly in C/C++.

cgdb-0.3.3a

	* Fixed bug in the file dialog window. It would not accept the enter
	key, so the user could never select a file.

cgdb-0.3.3

	* Fixed tab bug, where tab spaces were being displayed incorrectly in 
	the source window. Now cgdb can handle tabs in a file properly.

	* Added VI-style page up/page down commands. Deprecated old Shift-J 
	and Shift-K page up/page down style commands.

	* Fixed bug in ada highlighter. The file would not be displayed correctly 
	when trying to highlight an ada source file.

cgdb-0.3.2

	* Fast tokenizer replaces older hand written one. CGDB now can syntax
	highlight a 15000+ line ada or c file in fractions of a second compared 
	to the second it used to take. Believe me, 1 second to load a file 
	can get frustrating when you wait enough times. :)

	* CGDB now reads $HOME/.cgdb/cgdbrc, this is useful for automating
	any commands the user would normally type into the status bar.
	This is a *great* first attempt at making cgdb configurable.

	* There are *many* new options to type into the status bar, 
	they are all listed in the README file, or from :help, check it out.
