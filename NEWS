cgdb-0.3.2

	* Fast tokenizer replaces older hand written one. CGDB now can syntax
	highlight a 15000+ line ada or c file in fractions of a second compared 
	to the second it used to take. Believe me, 1 second to load a file 
	can get frustrating when you wait enough times. :)

	* CGDB now reads $HOME/.cgdb/cgdbrc, this is useful for automating
	any commands the user would normally type into the status bar.
	This is a *great* first attempt at making cgdb configurable.
