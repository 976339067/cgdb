There is documentation available for starting and using CGDB in the doc/
directory. 
  - http://cgdb.sourceforge.net/documentation.shtml will provide you with
    an HTML view of the manual, and possibly some other formats.
  - Look at doc/cgdb.info for the info manual. 
  - The plain text version of the manual is provided here doc/cgdb.txt.
  - cgdb/doc/cgdb.1 will provide you with the man page.

If you are interested in building CGDB from CVS, please look at the 
section "Building CGDB from source" in the manual. This will describe
all of the tools necessary that you will need in order to do this.

Enjoy.
