    =           -> Grow source window 1 line
    _           -> Shrink source window 25%
                   (or, shrink tty window 1 line, if visible)
    +           -> Grow source window 25% 
                   (or, grow tty window 1 line, if visible)

    Shortcut Commands
    ------------------
    NOTE: use ':set sc' and ':set nosc' to enable or disable
    n           -> next
    s           -> step
    u           -> up
    d           -> down
    f           -> finish
    r           -> run
    c           -> continue

    Colon commands
    --------------
    NOTE: all options are off by default
    :continue    -> send a continue command to gdb
    :finish      -> send a finish command to gdb
    :help        -> Opens the help dialog
    :insert      -> move focus to the gdb window
    :next        -> send a next command to gdb
    :quit        -> Quit cgdb (may be abbreviated as :q)
    :quit!       -> Quit cgdb, even if debugged program is running (abbreviated
                    as :q!)

    The following variables change the behavior of some aspect of cgdb.  Many
    of these commands may be abbreviated in some way, and all boolean commands
    my be negated by appending 'no' to the front.  For example: 
        :set ignorecase
    turns on case-insensitive searching; while
        :set noignorecase
    turns on case-sensitive searching.

    :set ignorecase -> Sets searching case insensitive (:set ic)
    :set shortcut   -> Enables shortcut commands typed in source window 
                       (:set sc)
    :set winsplit   -> Set the split point between source and gdb window
                       (especially useful as an init setting in cgdbrc)
                       values={top_full, top_big, even, bottom_big, bottom_full}
                       (:set ws)
    :set winminheight -> The minimal height of a window. Windows will never 
                       become smaller than this value.
                       (:set wmh)
    :set tabstop    -> Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for.
    :set syntax     -> Sets the current highlighting mode of the current file.
                       values={c,ada,off}
                       (:set syn)
    :set escdelay   -> Set the length of time to wait before timing out and 
                       treating the ESC keystroke as the ESC character rather 
                       than combining it with other characters in the buffer to
                       create a key sequence. The variable is measured in 
                       milli seconds. If ESCDELAY is 0, the system immediately 
                       composes the ESCAPE response without waiting for more 
                       information from the buffer. The user may choose any 
                       value between 0 and 10000, inclusive. The default 
                       setting for the ESCDELAY environment variable is 40 
                       (forty tenths of a second).

2. At gdb and tty window
------------------------
    ESC         -> Back to source window
    page up     -> up a page
    page down   -> down a page
    F11         -> home
    F12         -> end

Using CGDB:
-----------

The CGDB user interface consists of two windows.  The "source window" is
on top, the "GDB window" is on bottom.  The interface has two modes,
depending on which window is focused.  "CGDB mode" is when the source
window is focused, "GDB mode" is when the GDB window is focused.

When CGDB is invoked, the interface is in GDB mode.  A '*' at the right
of the status bar indicates that input will be passed to GDB.  To change
the focus to the source window, hit ESC.  The interface is now in CGDB
mode.

To switch back into GDB mode, press 'i'.  This syntax is based on the
popular Unix text-editor, vi.

Passing Input to Programs:
--------------------------

This is similar to getting in and out of gdb mode. The tty window is not
visible by default. This is because it is only needed if the user wishes
to send data to the program being debugged. To display the tty window,
hit 'T' while in command mode. After hitting 'T' you will notice that
there is another window in the middle of the 'source window' and the
'gdb window'.  This is called the 'tty window'. You will also see a new
status bar called the tty status bar. There will be a '*' on the tty
status bar after the 'T' was hit. This is because when the window is
opened with the 'T' command, cgdb automatically puts the user into 'tty
mode'. To get out of this window hit 'ESC'. This will put you back into
command mode. To make the tty window appear and disappear hit the 'T'
key while in command mode. It is a toggle.

Once the tty window is already open, the user can then hit 't' in
command mode to get into tty mode. The user can then hit 'ESC' in tty
mode to get back into command mode.

When the tty window is open, all data that comes from the program, goes
there.  Any data typed into the tty window will ONLY go to the program
being debugged.  It will not go to gdb. When the tty window is closed,
all output from the debugged program will go to the 'gdb window' AND to
the 'tty window' ( for viewing later when the tty window is opened ) . 

If the user wishes to get a new tty for the program being debugged then
they can type 'Control T'. This will delete all the buffered data
waiting to be read into the debugged program. This might be useful when
you rerun or start a new program.

Automating Commands in CGDB:
----------------------------

There may be several features that you find usefull in CGDB. CGDB is capable
of automating any of these commands through the use of the config file called
cgdbrc. It looks in $HOME/.cgdb/cgdbrc for the file. If it exists, CGDB
executes each line in the file in order. It is as if the user typed in all the
commands into the status bar after the tui was initialized.

Eventually this file will be used to create macros and high level key 
bindings. Until then, it is a very usefull way to automate simple commands.
