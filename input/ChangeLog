    * Fixed all files to work with autoconf: All of the files that make up
    the input lib now test to see if a header is available before it is 
    included.

    * Adding an initial list of key alt and alt-shift key bindings
    * Commenting out most alt, shift-alt key bindings: These new key bindings 
    are breaking the input library. They are getting confused with other
    longer key mappings that have the alt-key mappings as a subset.
    * Removed printf's from input.c: Now it writes to err_msg

    * Adding the Alt-A through Alt-Z key bindings

    * Adding the input interface for the first time: This should help cgdb
    read input esc sequences and still perform functions at a high level.
