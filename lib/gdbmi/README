This package implements the gdbmi protocol. Currently, it simply parses an MI 
output command into a parse tree.

If you want to build this package, you need to have the auto tools installed. 
Once that is done, run ./autoregen.sh to generate the ./configure script.
Alternativly, you can download CGDB, which has a version of this library with
the auto files already created.
