- Strip readline out of TGDB and put it into CGDB. 
  This is in preparation for removing the rlctx code.
- Look into Crash on Mac (OSX Jaguar).
- Think about how to handle MAC formatted files on unix.
- Fix ACS_VLINE problem. This char is not available everywhere and 
  should be a runtime option. Check with jonathon to make sure this problem
  is fixed.  (Actually, check on ALL ACS characters, we use several of them.)
- Use valgrind to get rid of most memory leaks.

Bug fixes for cgdb-0.5.3

Closed:

- Get readline library to only build the static library.
- Update FAQ, it's wrong.
- Fix runtime error with arrow style long and regex searching.
- Should package readline with CGDB?  Yes!
- Make sure arrowstyle option is commented.
- Get ^l to refresh the screen.
- Fix compiler warning 
../../../../cgdb/tgdb/tgdb-base/src/tgdb.c: In function `tgdb_recv_debugger_data':
../../../../cgdb/tgdb/tgdb-base/src/tgdb.c:1254: warning: passing arg 5 of `tgdb_client_parse_io' from incompatible pointer type

Bug fixes for cgdb-0.5.2

Closed:

- Make DESTDIR work in Makefile for installing CGDB
    http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=6966700&forum_id=26100
- Make the autoconf stuff check for version .5.1 of readline
- Fix bug on sf.net. It is a compile error that happens to show up as a warning in
  cygwin. Fix the warning and the error might go away.

Bug fixes for cgdb-0.5.1

Closed:

- Fix race condition on waitpid
- Fix --args command line option
- Make sure when EOF is read that CGDB dies.

Bug fixes before cgdb-0.3.2 release.

Bugs:

o Fix ws option. It doesn't lock properly. Resize window real small, then
  resize it big, its not the correct percent.
o Make ws option receive a percent, so we can make it any size.
  Not just the 5 choices originally desired. It would be more flexible 
  this way. I would be silly if someone needed 35% ...
  However, making it take a percent does not solve the whole problem.
  The user needs to start at one of these offsets. How should this be done?

Closed:

o Fix 'set sc' flicker problem. When user hits 'n', a flicker occurs.
o Fix resizing to fast bug. ( Only handle last resize, not all ).
  This is easy to reproduce when running over the Internet. :)
  This doesn't really seem to be the problem. However, the potential
  bug is still fixed.
o Make -/+ go to either full screen or 2 lines off, on odd or even size.
  This was fixed by adding option winminheight :) (Ben's idea),
  Now you can make the value whatever you want it to be.
