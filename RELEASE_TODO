Bug fixes for cgdb-0.5.1

- Fix race condition on waitpid
- Fix --args command line option

Bug fixes before cgdb-0.3.2 release.

Bugs:

o Fix ws option. It doesn't lock properly. Resize window real small, then
  resize it big, its not the correct percent.
o Make ws option receive a percent, so we can make it any size.
  Not just the 5 choices originally desired. It would be more flexible 
  this way. I would be silly if someone needed 35% ...
  However, making it take a percent does not solve the whole problem.
  The user needs to start at one of these offsets. How should this be done?

Closed:

o Fix 'set sc' flicker problem. When user hits 'n', a flicker occurs.
o Fix resizing to fast bug. ( Only handle last resize, not all ).
  This is easy to reproduce when running over the Internet. :)
  This doesn't really seem to be the problem. However, the potential
  bug is still fixed.
o Make -/+ go to either full screen or 2 lines off, on odd or even size.
  This was fixed by adding option winminheight :) (Ben's idea),
  Now you can make the value whatever you want it to be.
